#Coupled NMF Clustering

##starters
The first stage of the research, which covers the analysis of NMF methods.

##face_clustering
Algorithms are tested on facial data.

##reconstruct_roger
My effort to reconstruct Rogers' algorithm and result.

##innovation
Developing the NMF coupled clustering algorithm. The best version used in paper is 'CoNMF\_v4\_flow.m'.

##synthesis_data
Synthesis data generation and performances comparison for different algorithms.

##final_research
Further comparison of performances in more complex cases.

#Reference
The library of NMF including 'nmf.m', 'nnlsm\_activeset.m', 'nnlsm\_blockpivot.m', 'solveNormalEqComb.m' is used.
